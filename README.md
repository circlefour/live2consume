# - LIVE TO CONSUME -
i want to consume as much internet content indiscriminately as i can in as short a time frame as i can.

this marks the beginning of that quest.

in this sub arc i will be collecting a database of semi-random video ids using the youtube data api.

i will be using this database to watch random videos at high speeds as quickly as possible once a large number [ tbd ]  of ids are collected.

this database will be for personal and artistic use and consumption. to acquire a varied understanding of the *broadcast yourself* landscape.

initially i was considering generating random ids, but quickly realized this would be infeasible as youtube ids take the form of :
- 11 random characters
    - A-Z
    - a-z
    - 0-9
    - _

in a string, leading to 63^11 possibilites.

scraping seems to be against yt tos.

so i capitulate to being limited by api restrictions and i will patiently collect.
